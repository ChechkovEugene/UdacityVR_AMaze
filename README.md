# Udacity VRND course Project 3 A Maze

The goal is to design and create fully interactive VR experience in the form of
a maze

Waypoint Navigation : Waypoints will be how the user moves through the maze.
They become highlighted when the user looks at them - and when clicked they
play a sound and move the user to their location
(either by motion or teleportation.)

Collectables : Along the paths and between the waypoints are coins that can
be collected. They play a sound and spawn some particles when you click on
this and collect them.

The Gate : A barrier that blocks the path to exit. Once you
have the key it animates open and unblocks the path.

The Key : Somewhere within the maze, out of sight of the gate, is a
key which unlocks it. You must collect it manually, looking at it to
highlight it and clicking on it to retrieve it. Once triggered, it plays a
sound and spawns some particles to show it's being collected. Once you have
the key you can return to the gate and make your way to the finish.

The UI : At the end you'll display a UI message to congratulate the maze
explorer on their success. Clicking this UI then reloads the scene to its
original state.
